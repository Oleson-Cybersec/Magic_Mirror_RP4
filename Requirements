For our magic mirror project, you can refer to the **Magic Mirror v2** requirements to get a full list. I will simply be referring to what I've used or recommendations as I went overboard to be safe. Things to also consider are what options you're looking for when buying your Raspberry Pi.

When purchasing a RP4, I'd recommend at least _2 GB RAM_. I'd also purchase one that has _Wifi capabilities_ installed in order to maintain a slim profile with less cable management.

For the operating system and files we'll be adding, I'd recommend at least 8 GB MicroSD card to be safe. The OS will take about 2 GB of storage and the rest can have space for files and backups if you mess anything up along the way.

**Additional Notes**
Physical:
- You could buy a Raspberry Pi kit that comes with most of the accessories you would need as it might be the more cost-effective route. However, if buy everything seperately, you guarentee you have all the right items, and not adding more accessories to your junk drawer.
